-> cd my-app
-> npm install

npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/macbookpro/.npm/_logs/2025-05-19T13_43_25_345Z-debug-0.log

Solution:(it did not work) Check the node version, if it's above 20+, downgrade it to 20
Use 'NVM' to do it. If don't have it install, install it first. 

Solution 2: Open the file "package.json" of the route below and check for "bin", If the "bin" field is missing, the package is broken.
node_modules/tailwindcss/package.json. SO USE THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE TO INSTALL IT.

#Install ShadCN UI
-> Follow the OFFICIAL WEBSITE
- It will add the Button component to your project.
-> npx shadcn@latest add button

# ROUTING 
- Add Routing (React Router)
-> npm install react-router-dom
Note: use it the main.js file. import this "BrowserRouter" and then Setup Routes in App.jsx by importing these {Routes, Route, Link}


# Add State Management (Zustand)
Zustand is modern, simple, and lightweight — like Riverpod for Flutter.

- Install Zustand
-> npm install zustand

- First create a store
Note: create a file for it.

- Then bind your components, and that's it!

#  Setup Axios for Backend Requests 
NOTE: Create a folder called "lib". Route "src/lib/axios.js"
- Install Axio 
-> npm install axios

NOTE:
inset-0:
This sets all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) of the element to 0.
When used with position: fixed or absolute, it makes the element stretch to cover the entire parent or viewport.
In your modal, it ensures the overlay covers the whole screen.

z-50:
This sets the CSS z-index to 50.
A higher z-index means the element will appear above other elements with a lower z-index.
In your modal, it ensures the overlay appears on top of everything else.

Summary:
fixed inset-0 z-50 makes your modal overlay cover the whole screen and appear above all other content.

NOTE:
To place the text on top of the banner image and centered, you should use absolute positioning 
with a relatively positioned parent. Here’s how you can do it:

NOTE:
flex-grow border-t creates horizontal lines that expand to fill the space.
The span with "OR" is centered with margin on both sides.
my-10 adds vertical spacing above and below the separator.

NOTE:
The rel attribute in an <a> tag specifies the relationship between the current page and the linked page.
When you use target="_blank" (which opens the link in a new tab), it’s important for security to also add:

noopener: Prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property, which protects your page from certain types of attacks.
noreferrer: Prevents the browser from sending the address (referrer) of your page to the new page.
In summary:
rel="noopener noreferrer" is a best practice for external links opened in a new tab, for security and privacy reasons.

NOTE:

For smooth scrolling, add this to your CSS (e.g., in index.css):

- like this:

@import "tailwindcss";
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

NOTE: This will install the entire react-icons package, which includes the fi (Feather Icons)
npm install react-icons --save

NOTE: To control the command k
-> npm i cmdk


NOTE:
In HTML, clicking a <button> inside a <form> triggers the form's default submit action, which reloads the page.
In React, you need to call e.preventDefault() in your event handler to stop this.

NOTE:
To run two React (Vite) projects at the same time, you need to change the port

1. Open your project's root folder in VS Code.
2. In your terminal, run the Vite dev server with a custom port using: Replace 5174 with any available port number.
3. Alternatively, set the port in your vite.config.js:
