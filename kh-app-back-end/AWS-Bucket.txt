STEP 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1️⃣ Log into AWS Console and go to the S3 service.

2️⃣ Click “Create bucket”.

Bucket name: e.g., my-image-storage.

Region: Choose your preferred region.

3️⃣ Uncheck “Block all public access” if you want public URLs (recommended for images).

⚠️ Be careful with sensitive data—public access means anyone can access these files.

4️⃣ Click “Create bucket”.


 STEP 2: Upload an Image (Test)
1️⃣ Go into your new bucket.
2️⃣ Click “Upload” and add an image file.
3️⃣ After uploading, click the file and copy the “Object URL”—this is your direct link!

(Destination -> s3://kh-images-bucket/images/)


STEP 3: Configure Bucket Policy for Public Read Access
To let users access images publicly (if you want):

1️⃣ Go to the “Permissions” tab in your bucket.
2️⃣ Click “Bucket Policy” and add:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::kh-images-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}

⚙️ STEP 4: Connect from Node.js

- You’ll need the AWS SDK:
-> npm install aws-sdk
