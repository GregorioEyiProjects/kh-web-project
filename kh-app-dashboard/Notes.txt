- FormData

is a built-in JavaScript browser API (not imported from any library) that lets you easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, including files.
It is used to send form data, especially files, via HTTP requests (like POST) to a server, typically with multipart/form-data encoding.
You do not need to import itâ€”it is available globally in browsers.

- The "image/*"
The accept="image/*" attribute on the <input type="file" /> element tells the browser to only allow the user to select image files (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) from their device.
It filters the file picker dialog to show only image files, making it easier for users to pick the correct file type.
